    <h2>Hello! Welcome to my page!</h2>
    <p class = "description">My name is Dennis Cho. I have been spending my time learning the ins and outs of web developement and software engineering. 
      I am excited to start my journey with <strong>Flatiron Academy!</strong> One of my favorite hobbies to do in my free time is rock climbing. Rock climbing has become extremely popular the past few years
      and the sport has finally been introduced to the next upcoming Olympics in Japan. 
    </p>
    <p class = "description">Today, I will break down the three categories of climbing as will be shown in the Olympics.</p>

  <div class = "bouldering">
    <h2 class = "title">Bouldering</h2>
    <p class = "description">
      Bouldering is my personal favorite style of climbing. It consist of dynamic and technical moves on shorter walls, usually under 20 feet tall.
      Since the walls are shorter, the climber can climb without a harness and safely fall down onto a large padded mat below them.

    <h2 class = "title">Sport Climbing</h2>
    <p class = "description">
      Sport climbing is another form of climbing where the climber is required to use a harness, a rope, and a belayer. Your belayer will catch you with specific belaying techniques so the climber falls on the rope and not the ground. 
      Unlike bouldering, the walls are much higher, averaging around 50 feet high. As the climber climbs up the wall, there will be carabiners in the wall where the climber must clip their rope into the carabiner for protection.  
      Sport climbing is known for its technicality and endurance style climbing. The climber must find the most efficient way of moving up the wall to prevent themselves from getting too fatigued.

  <div class = "speedClimbing">
    <h2 class = "title">Speed Climbing</h2>
    <p class = "description">
      Speed climbing is the last category that will be introduced in the Olympics this year. Just as it sounds, Speed Climbing is all about speed.
      Climbers face off two at a time and compete to get to the top with the quickest time. Climbers will wear a harness and be hooked up to an AutoBelay. 
      An AutoBelay is a special device hooked up at the top of the wall that will catch the climbers when they fall. AutoBelays are faster than a human belayer and is safer for the climbers in this specific category. 
      The route for Speed Climbing is universal and hasn't changed since it was first introduced.
